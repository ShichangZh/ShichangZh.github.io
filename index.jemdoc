=== About Me
I am Shichang (Ray) Zhang. I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [https://d3.harvard.edu/ D^3 Institute at Harvard University] working with Professor [https://himalakkaraju.github.io/ Hima Lakkaraju]. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [http://www.ucla.edu/ University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)], where I was very fortunate to have Professor [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/ Yizhou Sun] as my advisor. My Ph.D. research was generously supported by the [https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2023 J.P. Morgan Chase AI Ph.D. Fellowship] and the [https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/2023-amazon-fellows/ Amazon Fellowship]. Before joining UCLA, I received my M.S. and B.A., both in Statistics, from [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford] and [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley] respectively. 

During my Ph.D. at UCLA, I organized the Data Mining Reading Group for two years. Slides and recordings of the reading groups can be found [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/reading/course.html here]. My presentations at the reading group can be found under [talks.html Talks].

# , where I held cutting-edge research papers readings, AI course studies, and hosted 13 guest speakers from both academia and industry. The AI courses we covered included neurosymbolic methods, diffusion models, large language models, differential geometry, spectral graph theory, neural radiance fields, and many more. 

# Please feel free to email me if you are interested in becoming a guest speaker. We especially welcome senior-year PhDs to practice their job talks and the first authors to present their recent work published in top conferences.
