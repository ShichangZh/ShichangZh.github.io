=== About Me
I am currently a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [https://www.cs.ucla.edu/ Computer Science] at [http://www.ucla.edu/ University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)] [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/ Data Mining Lab] working with Professor [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/ Yizhou Sun]. My research is generously supported by the [https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2023 J.P. Morgan Chase AI Ph.D. Fellowship] and the [https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/2023-amazon-fellows/ Amazon Fellowship]. Before joining UCLA, I received my B.A. and M.S. both in Statistics from [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley] and [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford] respectively. 


I organize the UCLA Data Mining Reading Group. The reading group operates in three formats, reading cutting-edge AI research papers, studying a comprehensive AI course per quarter, and guest talks. Our AI course for this quarter is Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML). In the past, we have covered diffusion models, large language models, differential geometry, probabilistic graphical models, spectral graph theory, and neural radiance fields. Please find past slides and recordings [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/reading/course.html here]. My presentations at the reading group can be found under [talks.html Talks].

If you are interested in becoming a guest speaker, please feel free to email me. We especially welcome senior-year PhDs to practice their job talks and the first authors to present their recent works published in top conferences.
