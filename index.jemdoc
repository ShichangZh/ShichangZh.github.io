=== About Me
I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. student in [https://www.cs.ucla.edu/ Computer Science] at [http://www.ucla.edu/ University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)] [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/ Data Mining Lab] working with Professor [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/ Yizhou Sun]. Before joining UCLA, I received my B.A. and M.S. both in Statistics from [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley] and [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford] respectively.
