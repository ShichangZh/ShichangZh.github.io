=== About Me
I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in [https://www.cs.ucla.edu/ Computer Science] at [http://www.ucla.edu/ University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)] [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/ Data Mining Lab] working with Professor [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/ Yizhou Sun]. My research is generously supported by the [https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2023 J.P. Morgan Chase AI Ph.D. Fellowship] and the [https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/2023-amazon-fellows/ Amazon Fellowship]. Before joining UCLA, I received my B.A. and M.S. both in Statistics from [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley] and [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford] respectively. 

I organize the UCLA Data Mining Reading Group. The reading group includes cutting-edge research papers, AI courses, and guest talks. Our AI course for this quarter is Neurosymbolic methods. In the past, we have covered physics-informed machine learning, diffusion models, large language models, differential geometry, probabilistic graphical models, spectral graph theory, and neural radiance fields. Please find past slides and recordings [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/reading/course.html here]. My presentations at the reading group can be found under [talks.html Talks].

Please feel free to email me if you are interested in becoming a guest speaker. We especially welcome senior-year PhDs to practice their job talks and the first authors to present their recent work published in top conferences.
