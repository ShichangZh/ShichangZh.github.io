=== About Me
I am currently a forth-year Ph.D. student in [https://www.cs.ucla.edu/ Computer Science] at [http://www.ucla.edu/ University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)] [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/ Data Mining Lab] working with Professor [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/ Yizhou Sun]. Before joining UCLA, I received my B.A. and M.S. both in Statistics from [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley] and [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford] respectively. [cv/shichangzhang_cv.pdf \[CV\]]

I am organizing the UCLA Data Mining Reading Group. We cover interesting graph machine learning papers every week. Please check the past slides and recordings [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/reading/paper.html here]. The reading group also dig deep into one interesting AI topic each quarter. The topic for this quarter is Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In the past, we have covered diffusion models, large language models, differential geometry, graphical models, and spectral graph theory. Please find past slides and recordings [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/reading/course.html here]. My personal presentations at the reading group can be found under [talks.html Talks].
