=== About Me
I am Shichang (Ray) Zhang. I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [https://d3.harvard.edu/ D^3 Institute at Harvard University] working with Professor [https://himalakkaraju.github.io/ Hima Lakkaraju]. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [http://www.ucla.edu/ University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)] advised by Professor [http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/ Yizhou Sun]. My Ph.D. research was generously supported by the [https://www.jpmorgan.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/research-awards/phd-fellowship-2023 J.P. Morgan Chase AI Ph.D. Fellowship] and the [https://www.sciencehub.ucla.edu/2023-amazon-fellows/ Amazon Fellowship]. Before UCLA, I received my M.S. and B.A., both in Statistics, from [https://statistics.stanford.edu/ Stanford] and [https://statistics.berkeley.edu/ Berkeley], respectively. 

My research aims to *scientifically understand AI to ensure it is trustworthy and beneficial to humanity*. I have developed principled methods to analyze and improve the trustworthiness of AI systems across the *full spectrum* from data to model to training: 
(1) Data-wise, I design methods to examine how data features drive AI decisions at inference time, with applications in [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08627 science], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12465 e-commerce], and [https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/isre.2023.0029?journalCode=isre healthcare]. (2) Model-wise, I study large language models (LLMs) to reveal their [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02904 internal mechanisms] and [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.10635v2 reasoning capabilities], enabling task-specific [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09612 interpretable models] built upon them. (3) Training-wise, I develop techniques to measure the training influence on AI behavior, providing new tools for [https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ghp4GWDFd1 training data assessment], [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.00175 model auditing, and credit assignment to developers]. Collectively, my research moves beyond black-box empiricism toward a holistic scientific understanding of AI.

# During my Ph.D. at UCLA, I organized the Data Mining Reading Group for two years. Slides and recordings of the reading groups can be found [https://ucla-dm.github.io/DM_website/reading/course.html here]. My presentations at the reading group can be found under [talks.html Talks].

# , where I held cutting-edge research papers readings, AI course studies, and hosted 13 guest speakers from both academia and industry. The AI courses we covered included neurosymbolic methods, diffusion models, large language models, differential geometry, spectral graph theory, neural radiance fields, and many more. 

# Please feel free to email me if you are interested in becoming a guest speaker. We especially welcome senior-year PhDs to practice their job talks and the first authors to present their recent work published in top conferences.
