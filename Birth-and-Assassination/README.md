This is an undergraduate research project. A dynamic visualization of a special branching processes, called the "Birth and Assassination" process, a modification of the Galton-Watson branching process. This project is based on a paper written by David Aldous, a professor of statistics department of the University of California, Berkeley. The original paper can be found here:

This is a variation of the simple Galton-Walton branching process, which the particle's death only happens if its is parent dead. Thus each particle has an initial period of time in which it can producing offspring but is not at risk of dying; While the particle lives, all of its descendants may have their own offspring, but none of them are at risk of dying. Note that current particles produce offsprings following a poisson process. Both the birth and killing distribution can be determined by the user by setting the parameters below.
